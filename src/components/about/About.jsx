              Hello there, my name is Thau√£ Engelmann. I am a{" "}
              <span>self-taught</span> web developer based on Sapiranga, Brazil.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have been challenging myself through <span>front-end</span> for
              the past year, and eventually I started to enjoy the idea behind
              each line of code. Now, as professionally connected with the
              software industry, I am interest on front-end scope and free for
              new opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am a big fan of animations, transitions, shadows and things like
              that. I think all of this stuff can be really cool and always give
              a unique perspective on websites.
            </p>
